🔮 AI Destiny Master (AI 命理大师)

A mystical, single-file web application that uses Google Gemini 2.5 Vision to analyze palmistry and physiognomy.

📖 Introduction

AI Destiny Master is a lightweight, serverless web app designed to simulate a traditional fortune-telling experience. By leveraging the multimodal capabilities of Google's Gemini API, it can "see" user-uploaded photos of hands or faces and generate detailed, culturally relevant readings in Simplified Chinese.

It is built as a Single File Application, meaning all logic, styling, and markup reside in one index.html file for ultimate portability.
